The beam was dumped at ~5 TeV by RF trip of module M1B2 (crowbar) also triggering all ARC detectors. After first investigations CCC did a reset and resume operation. When passing to injection physics beams (RF voltage to 58 kV) the same M1B2 tripped again with the same crowbar fault. Restart by slowly increasing the voltage.
