Events:
FPA events > quench events, event, instance
FPA trigger > quench detection time (Intro and available data)
additional, multiple quench > secondary quench (check if not established term)
QDS measurement unit > QPS crate 

Signals:
voltage transients > transient changes
voltage signal > signal
frequency spectrum > frequency signal, frequency, frequency response, frequency data points

Circuit:
magnet ID > magnet name
EE system > EE switches

sector != circuit (mention Zugangspunkte)
magnet != cold mass

NMF:
reconstruction loss > error
window function > window
spectral component > frequency components > components, vectors
frequency component measured at the magnet > frequency component of the magnet

Component interpretation:
maximum > peak
average maximum amplitude > mean peak value
location of maximum > peak location
propagate > spread
root cause < physical process
origin of root cause < physical source, physical origin
do not use $\mathbf{h}_k$
Electrical propagation, Physical propagation, Artificial propagation > el. distance propagation % todo in table

Anomalies:
LHC maintenance stop > YETS, LS3
anomalies > outlier
non-normal > anomalous 
normal > nominal
activation of EE systems > opening of EE systems
diode opening
physical process > root causes > scenario
